# Data Science
a repository of my projects using machine learning, statistical modeling, and deep learning in data science.
1. In the heart disease prediction project, I used Python's sklearn library to create classifiers that achieved an F1 score, indicating data prediction accuracy of over 85%. I applied various data preprocessing techniques, including feature and label transformations, feature selection, and data scaling. I experimented with different models, including logistic regression, SVM, and random forest, to identify the best-performing one.
2. Image Classification Project:
I used Python's PyTorch and a classical pipeline for image classification in this project.
Data Preprocessing,
I began by loading and converting the image data from raw vectors to tensors. I used data loaders and a composition of transformers, including horizontal flipping, normalization, and tensor conversion.
Model Selection and Hyperparameters,
I selected a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that was appropriate for my specific task. I found that increasing the number of output channels in the model architecture often improved performance. I also tuned hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and model depth, highlighting the need for experimentation to find the optimal values.
Loss Function and Optimization,
I defined a loss function for the task, with cross-entropy loss being my choice for image classification. To optimize the model, I used the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which is known for its fast convergence and adaptability to large datasets.
Training,
With the setup complete, I specified the number of epochs for training. I noted that increasing the number of epochs typically improved the accuracy on the training data, but I also emphasized the need to monitor for overfitting.
Testing,
The model I trained achieved an accuracy of 57% in predicting image classifications
