# machine-learning
a repository of my projects using machine learning in data science
1. In the heart disease prediction project, I used Python's sklearn library to create classifiers that achieved an F1 score, indicating data prediction accuracy of over 85%. I applied various data preprocessing techniques, including feature and label transformations, feature selection, and data scaling. I experimented with different models, including logistic regression, SVM, and random forest, to identify the best-performing one.
