# Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, and Deep Learning Notebooks

## Description

This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to demonstrate and document the processes of machine learning, statistical modeling, and deep learning. The notebooks serve as a comprehensive guide that covers the theory and practical application of data science techniques in different scenarios. Each notebook is self-contained and focuses on a specific topic within the data science workflow, from data preparation and visualization to advanced model training and evaluation.

Key features of this project:
- **Modularity**: Each notebook is designed to be independent and focuses on a single aspect of data science.
- **Transferability**: While the examples provided are self-contained, the methods and code snippets are designed to be easily transferable to other data science projects.
- **Best Practices**: Emphasizes data science best practices, including code readability, data exploration, and effective visualization techniques.
- **Reproducibility**: With detailed comments and explanations, other users can follow along and reproduce the results or adapt the workflows to their own datasets.

## Installation

To set up a local development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/SiyuWu528/data_science.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
```
cd data-science
```
3. It is recommended to create a virtual environment to keep the dependencies required by the project separate from your global Python environment:
For virtualenv:
```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```
For conda environments:
```
conda create --name ds-notebooks python=3.8
conda activate ds-notebooks
```
4. Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
 ```
jupyter notebook
 ```
or
 ```
jupyter lab
 ```
